# Autonomous-Vehicle-Localization-Using-Onboard-Sensor-and-HD-Geolocated-Maps-Project-Solution.
#Challenge Overview.
Autonomous vehicles are revolutionizing the way the current transportation system works and many companies are investing on this mega-trend technology to secure a share in this market. Researchers and engineers are combining efforts to achieve a full driving automation (Level 5) system that is safe and comfortable for the passengers. Localization is a key component of an autonomous vehicle to enable autonomous driving by processing and fusing sensory data for accurate results and making adaptive models to handle different individual sensors' errors to come up with highly dependable estimates.

#Aim of this Repo.
This is our proposed solution repository for Project #20 (Autonomous Vehicle Localization Using Onboard Sensors and HD Geolocated Maps) as a team consisting of two senior Mechatronics Students (Hazem Mohsen - Yousra Adly) - Faculty of Engineering Ain Shams University, Egypt. under the supervision of Prof. Mohammed Ibrahim Awad.
in this repository we discuss a sequence in which we progress from getting started with the challenge and the used toolboxes to evaluating different localization techniques on both [Synthatic scenes provided by ADT & Real-time driving scenarios from KITTI data-set]
